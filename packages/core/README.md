## Usage

### Portal

The `<ngx-portal/>` component displays the content on the body.

In the controller:

```typescript
import { PortalComponent } from '@ngx-popovers/core';
```
In the template:

```angular2html
<ngx-portal>
    <p>It will be displayed as the last child of the body</p>
</ngx-portal>
```
